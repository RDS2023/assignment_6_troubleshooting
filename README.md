ASSIGNMENT 8: FIX MY CODE

For this assignment, clone the repository onto your computer. You'll find an R 
Project and a script. As you run through the script, you're going to get a lot
of errors. Diagnose the errors, fix the code so that it no longer returns them, 
and add comments to explain what was going on and why the error came up. Save,
commit, and push back to the repository.
